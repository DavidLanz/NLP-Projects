# Introduction
Human reading comprehension belongs to cognitive psychology field. xx gives the first study about machine reading comprehension. babi datasets from Facebook proposes the AI complete concept.
- Different **comprehension types**
    - Literal 
    - Inference
    - Critical 
feature engineering based symbolic models and deep learning models
- [Tencent AI part 1](https://hanxiao.github.io/2018/04/21/Teach-Machine-to-Comprehend-Text-and-Answer-Question-with-Tensorflow/) gives detailed explanation about machine reading comprehension. 


# Models

- [R-Net](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/r-net.pdf)
- [S-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04815.pdf)
- [Multi-Passage Machine Reading Comprehension with Cross-Passage Answer Verification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02220.pdf)
- [Dual Ask-Answer Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01997)

# Dataset
- [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)
- [MS-MARCO](http://www.msmarco.org/)
  - Differences from SQuAD [4]
    - SQuAD constrains the answer to be an exact sub-span in the passage, while the answer in MS-MARCO may covers several passages.
    - SQuAD only has one passage for a question, while MS-MARCO contains multiple passages.
